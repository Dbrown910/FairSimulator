# Fair Simulation 

Just a school project where we built and used a simulation to determine which fair rides could generate the most revenue given varying # of seats per ride. Some of the initial assumptions are missing (i.e. how long the fair day is, express ticket lines, etc) but it's mainly to display some of my code and the results I generated

(Python 3) Run with cmd: python -u fair_sim.py
